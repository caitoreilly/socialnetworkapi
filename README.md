# socialnetworkapi

## Description 

---

For this Social Network web application, an API had to built to allow users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. This project required Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. This project entails performing a variety of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for users, thoughts, reactions, and friends using Insomnia. For further information about this application and how to use it, please visit my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/caitoreilly/socialnetworkapi.git).
